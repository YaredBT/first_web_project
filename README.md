Why we chose MongoDB?

The main reason is that the service of our website is providing information for our customers. So going for a documented database such as MongoDB was a better choice.
Other reasons are a need for:
•	Ease of scaling
•	Higher data availability
•	Deep query ability
•	Fast, automatic and instant data recovery
